                    Abni ambled back to the broken cart, kicking up the dust that blanketed the long-traveled road with every step. As he neared the tree to where he and Russ had shouldered the cart, he heard a low, lilting hum amidst the birds’ chirping. It was Russ, humming away as he tried to fashion a new piece of wood unto where the cart had fallen apart. The song, it seemed, seamlessly repeated, containing only a few tones that grew quickly familiar to Abni as he returned.
                    “I didn’t see anything out there. Ya sure you saw something?” Abni asked as he slumped onto the tree, scaring the birds away. Abni watched them flutter away, and a slight frown grew.
                    The humming stopped. “Yeah, I’m not stupid. You probably just didn’t look hard enough,” Russ said. “Sigh, it doesn’t matter anyhow. We’ll probably rest here ‘til tomorrow. Don’t think I can get it done in time. Grab that scrap piece, will you?”
                    Abni turned his head and found the pieces of boards that had broken off, just barely out of reach. He stretched for it, slowly dragging himself into the grass as he stubbornly proved his unwillingness to get up, and held it out to Russ.
                    “I don’t want it. Start making some tinder for the fire,” Russ said.
