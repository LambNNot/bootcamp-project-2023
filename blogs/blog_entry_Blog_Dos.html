                    The fire gently crackled and popped. Abni plopped down beside the fire and ate, listening as Russâ€™s lilting murmur went on and on. On closer inspection, the song seemed no longer than a half-minute until it looped all the way back to the beginning. Abni took an apple out of their bag and began eating. <br>

                    The two ate on the fireside as the day waned further. By the time they finished eating, the horses were already asleep. Abni hopped back into their shabby, wooden carriage and retreated under the comfort of his blanket. Russ, as usual, stood watch for a bit by the side of the cart. A few days have passed since Abni has actually witnessed Russ fall asleep, even though, Russ is always awake by the time he gets up.
